has been aggressively scanning Fortinet VPN servers vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary file read

 The IP has been observed scanning for openings over port 10443.
 In addition the actor has been observed utlizing NMAP in order to scan for open ports. 
 
 I then searched the IP in BinaryEdge and pulled the following data.

 For the readers of this report who are not familar with Jarm Hashing.
 I've included the link to the SalesForce/JARM Team Github page and their report on Medium.

 Finally my advise to the frontline IR/SOC analyst is to review your Inbound Scannning Dashboards in your SIEMs. 
 And report and scanning activity from this IP regardless if the traffic was successful or not.
